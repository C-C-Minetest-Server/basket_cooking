# Basket Cooking

Cooks stuffs in baskets all at once with technic furnaces!

1. Put stuffs into a [basket](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Emojiminetest/basket/). _All_ items in the basket must be smeltable, and the results must be contaianable by the basket, or it will not work.
2. Put the basket into the furnace. As all the smelting time accumulates, it takes a little bit of time for the furnace to calculate the output, and takes _very very long_ to process the items. For example, smelting 9 stacks of obsidian shard takes 4 minutes, and a full basket of wrought iron takes 14 minutes.
